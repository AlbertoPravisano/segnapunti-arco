# Webapp for archery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Developer with typescript, @reduxjs/toolkit, i18next and semantic-ui-react just for fun.

The app lets you keep the score of your archery matches with your friends. The score system is configurable, with a default 12 shots and 2 tracks configuration.
