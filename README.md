# Webapp for archery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Developer with typescript, @reduxjs/toolkit, i18next and semantic-ui-react just for fun.

The app lets you keep the score of your archery matches with your friends. The score system is configurable, with a default of 12 shots and 2 tracks configuration.

The application doesn't have a backend for now since it saves the players'history in localstorage.

---

Future releases will implement:

- Login system with management of your own groups of friends, your own match configuration etc.
- Statistics and graphs in the leaderboard
- More colors and animations
- More languages supported, maybe
- Mobile app with react native
